**Abstract**: RPG is a powerful training-free paradigm utilizing  proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini-Pro) and open-source local MLLMs (e.g., miniGPT-4) as the prompt recaptioner and region planner with our complementary regional diffusion to achieve SOTA text-to-image generation and editing. Our framework is very flexible and can generalize to arbitrary MLLM architectures and diffusion backbones. For MLLMs, despite the superior capabilities of proprietary MLLMs, it remains feasible to employ local MLLMs, such as MiniGPT-4, as a viable alternative. RPG is capable of generating image with super high resolutions, here is an example:

<table class="center">
    <tr>
    <td width=100% style="border: none"><img src="__asset__/demo/object/icefire.png" style="width:100%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="100%" style="border: none; text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word">Text prompt: A beautiful landscape with a river in the middle the left of the middle is in the evening and in the winter with a big iceberg and a small village while some people are skating on the river and some people are skiing, the right of the river is in the summer with a volcano in the morning and a small village while some people are playing.
</td>

## ðŸš© New Updates 

**[2024.1]** Our main code along with the demo release, with diffusion models supports **SDXL**, **SD v2.0/2.1** **SD v1.4/1.5** ,  and we can produce good results utilizing GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro. We are also compatible with local MLLMs, but due to the limited context window and the size the model, it cannot always yield good results, we will try to fix this problem in the future.

## TODO

- [ ] Update Gradio demo
- [ ] Release RPG for image editing
- [ ] Release RPG v2 with ControlNet
- [x] Release RPG v1

mv stablediffusion stable-diffusion-stability-ai
cd ..
```
**Here we put diffusion models in models/Stable-diffusion/ and the generated images in generated_imgs/ .**

**Download Checkpoints and MLLMs configuration**

In our experiments designed to attain state-of-the-art generative capabilities, we predominantly employ [SDXL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0),  [SDXL-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo), and [Playground v2](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic). To generate images of high fidelity across various styles, such as photorealism, cartoons, and anime, we judiciously incorporate certain models from [CIVITA](https://civitai.com/).  For images aspiring to photorealism, we advocate the use of [AlbedoBase XL](https://civitai.com/models/140737/albedobase-xl?modelVersionId=281176) , and [DreamShaper XL](https://civitai.com/models/112902/dreamshaper-xl?modelVersionId=251662). Moreover, we generalized our paradigm to SD v1.5 and SD v2.1 to accommodate a spectrum of requisites. All pertinent checkpoints are accessible within our Hugging Face spaces, with detailed descriptions found on the accompanying model cards.

We fervently recommend the utilization of GPT-4 or Gemini-Pro for users of Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs), as they not only exhibit superior performance but also conserve graphic memory. Our research utilized the A100 80GB, although it should be compatible with other graphics processing units providing a minimum of 12GB of VRAM. For those interested in executing MLLMs locally, we suggest deploying [miniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4) or directly engaging with substantial Local LLMs such as [Llama2-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) and  [Llama2-70b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf). It should be noted that [Llama2-7b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) has been observed to underperform and fails to yield accurate split ratios.
 

## Text-to-Image Generation

#### 1. Quick Start

For individuals equipped with constrained computational resources, we offer a bifurcated-version demonstration that partitions the image into two equal sized subregions. By making minor alterations to select functions within the diffusers library, one may achieve commendable outcomes utilizing base diffusion models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, v2.0, and v2.1, as mentioned in our paper. Additionally, you are welcome to apply your customized configurations to experiment with a graphics card possessing 8GB of VRAM. For an in-depth exposition, kindly refer to our [Example_Notebook](RegionalDiffusion_playground.ipynb).

#### **2. Demo** 

Note that we have uploaded detailed parameters of some examples in our paper, to make perfect reproduction, the only thing is to download the models we specify in [demo.py](template/demo.py) and run

```
python RPG.py --demo
```

You can find the results in outputs/txt2img-images which caches the generated history, or directly in generated_imgs/demo_imgs/

#### **3. Regional Generation with GPT-4**

A quintessential feature of our work is the absence of a prerequisite to pre-cache responses from MLLMs/LLMs. Our generative task unfolds in a wholly automated fashion, eschewing the necessity to manually transfer data from MLLMs, by capitalizing on our Chain-of-Thought reasoning paired with meticulously curated, high quality, in-context examples. The only task for the users is to have a comprehensive understanding of some specific parameters.  For example, to use GPT-4 as the planner, we can run:

```bash
python RPG.py --user_prompt 'A blonde hair girl with black suit and white skirt' --model_name 'input your model name here' --version_number 0 --api_key 'put your api_key here' --use_gpt
```

**--user_prompt** is the original prompt that roughly summarize the content contained in the image

**--model_name** is the name of the model in the directory models/Stable-diffusion/

**--version_number** is the class of our in-context examples used in generation. Our discoveries suggest that in varied scenarios, by employing pertinent in-context exemplars as few-shot samples, the planning capabilities of MLLMs can be substantially enhanced. For this case, we aim to synthesize a character bearing multiple attributes. We elect option 0, which is apt for a plan that binds multiple attributes.

**--api_key** is needed if you use GPT-4.

#### **4. Regional Generation with local LLMs**

We advocate for the deployment of a foundational model endowed with upwards of 13 billion parameters to realize outcomes that meet our exacting standards.  However, this will inevitably extend the model loading duration and the inference time, accompanied by a marked elevation in graphical memory consumption.  We conduct experiments on theses three base models. For the model with 13 billion parameters, the preferred apparatus is the A100 80GB, for 70B model, the recommended devices are 8*A100 80GB, here we take llama2-13b-chat as an example, we can run:

```bash
python RPG.py --user_prompt 'A blonde hair girl with black suit and white skirt' --model_name 'input your model name here' --version_number 0 --use_local --llm_path 'local_llms/ your llm name' 
```

In local version, we only need to clarify the local llm_path to use llm locally.

Here we can also specify other usual parameters in diffusion model like:

**--cfg** which is the context-free guidance scale

**--steps** the steps to generate an image

**--seed** control the seed to make the generation reproducible

**It should be noted that we also introduce some new parameters into diffusion generation:**

**--use_base** the function of this boolean variable is to activate the base prompt in diffusion process. Utilizing the base prompt signifies that we avoid the direct amalgamation of subregions as the latent representation. Instead, we use a foundational prompt that summarizes the image's key components and obatin the overall structure latent of the image. We then compute the weighted aggregate of these latents to yield the conclusive output. This method is instrumental in addressing the problems like omission of entities in complicated prompt generation tasks, and it also contributes to refining the edges of each subregion, ensuring they are seamlessly integrated and resonate harmony.

**--base_ratio** the weight of the base prompt latent, if too small, it is difficult to work, if too big, it will  confuse the composition and properties of subregions.  We conduct ablation experiment in our paper, see our paper for more detailed information and analysis.
